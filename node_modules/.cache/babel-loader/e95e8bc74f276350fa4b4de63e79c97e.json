This\n              tax rate is further reduced by the application of flat-rate\n              charges (charges forfaitaires): 50% on income up to €16.560 per\n              year (1st bracket) and 25% for the revenue from this number up to\n              €33.110 (2nd bracket).\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Concretely, the first €16.560 received by a copyright author\n              during a year is therefore taxed at a rate of 7.5% and the\n              following €16.560 is taxed at 11.25%. This is a far cry from the\n              marginal rate applied to professional income, which can rise above\n              50% (when social security contributions are taken into account).\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Attention, this regime is applicable up to €62.090 of copyright\n              income received per year (2021 figures).

It could be 100%, it could be 1%.

If\n              they don’t appear there, it means they probably did not pay them,\n              which means you will need to pay.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Bear in mind that withholdings paid by your clients are advance\n              payments in any case; your final taxes will be calculated based on\n              the full amount received during the year and you will have to pay\n              the difference at that point.
